# mustang-raider

Allow Fender Mustang series guitar amplifiers to be controlled by command line

# Introduction

Mustang-raider is a fork of Mustang-bridge with the midi part stripped down and changed to accept parameters

Special thanks to (similar to mustang-bridge project!):

  + The original developer and contributors to 'PLUG' who blazed the
  path with reverse-engineering of Fender's communication scheme.

  + Robert Fransson (Codesmart on VGuitar Forums) for feedback and
  encouragement - and for being a tireless programming wizard :-).

  + Robert Heitman, author of the Android 'Remuda' application for
  Mustang amp control, who provided valuable insights into various
  subtleties to snhirsch

 + snhirsch, for the work with mustang-bridge that i barely stole

## For everyone
